[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nxncode/random-passwords-generator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nxncode/random-passwords-generator)

Random passwords generator is used to generate passwords that may contain alphabets, number and special characters. The options parameter enables the user to enable or disabe the characters that are used to generate the password. The characters that may be choosen from are

* Lowercase Characters
* Uppercase Characters
* Numbers
* Special characters

The user may also opt to choose the first character in the password. The first character may one of the below.

* Lowercase Character
* Uppercase Character
* Number
* Special Character

The user may also specify the minimum number of character of each type. 

## Installation

`npm install random-passwords-generator`

## Usage

For the password to be generated, **PARAMETERS** should be passed as an optional **options** object.

If no parameter is passed, the default parameter will be taken as :

````javascript
options = {
      LENGTH: 10,
      ALLOW_ALPHABETS_LOWERCASE: true,
      ALLOW_ALPHABETS_UPPERCASE: true,
      ALLOW_NUMBERS: true,
      ALLOW_SPECIAL_CHARACTERS: true,
      EXCEPTIONS: "",
      FIRST_CHARACTER_LOWERCASE: true,
      FIRST_CHARACTER_UPPERCASE: false,
      FIRST_CHARACTER_NUMBER: false,
      FIRST_CHARACTER_SPECIAL_CHARACTER: false,
      MIN_ALPHABETS_LOWERCASE: 1,
      MIN_ALPHABETS_UPPERCASE: 1,
      MIN_NUMBERS: 1,
      MIN_SPECIAL_CHARACTERS: 1,
    };

````

The parameters are

1. **LENGTH** : the length of the password to be generated. **Default Value : 10**.
2. **ALLOW_ALPHABETS_LOWERCASE** : can take a boolean value that decides whether the password can have lowecase alphabets. **Default Value : true**.
3. **ALLOW_ALPHABETS_UPPERCASE** : can take a boolean value of  true or false. If true, the password generated can have uppercase characters. **Default Value : false**.
4. **ALLOW_NUMBERS:** : option  can take a boolean which  decides wherher the password generated can have numbers.
5. **ALLOW_SPECIAL_CHARACTERS** : option accepts boolean value and decides whether the password generated can have special characters.
The special characters are : ***!#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~***

6. **EXCEPTIONS** : exception takes in a string of characters that would not be used to generate the password. If "abc" is passed as exceptions, then the password willnot have the characters a,b,c

7. **FIRST_CHARACTER_LOWERCASE** - only if **ALLOW_ALPHABETS_LOWERCASE** is set to **true**, FIRST_CHARACTER_LOWERCASE will create a password that will have the first character as a lowercase character. **Default value is true.**

8. **FIRST_CHARACTER_UPPERCASE** - only if **ALLOW_ALPHABETS_UPPERCASE** is set to **true**, FIRST_CHARACTER_UPPERCASE will create a password that will have the first character as uppercase. **Default value is false**.

9. **FIRST_CHARACTER_NUMBER** - only if **ALLOW_NUMBERS** is set to **true**, FIRST_CHARACTER_NUMBER will create a password that will have the first character as number. **Default value is false**.

10. **FIRST_CHARACTER_SPECIAL_CHARACTER** - only if **ALLOW_SPECIAL_CHARACTERS** is set to **true**, FIRST_CHARACTER_SPECIAL_CHARACTER will create a password that will have the first character as special character. **Default value is false**.

11. **MIN_ALPHABETS_LOWERCASE** - only if **ALLOW_ALPHABETS_LOWERCASE** is set to **true**, MIN_ALPHABETS_LOWERCASE will create a password that will have minimum number of lower case characters in the password. **Default value is 1.**

12. **MIN_ALPHABETS_UPPERCASE** - only if **ALLOW_ALPHABETS_UPPERCASE** is set to **true**, MIN_ALPHABETS_UPPERCASE will create a password that will have minimum number of upper case characters in the password. **Default value is 1.**

13. **MIN_NUMBERS** - only if **ALLOW_NUMBERS** is set to **true**, MIN_NUMBERS will create a password that will have minimum number of numbers in the password. **Default value is 1.**

14. **MIN_SPECIAL_CHARACTERS** - only if **ALLOW_SPECIAL_CHARACTERS** is set to **true**, MIN_SPECIAL_CHARACTERS will create a password that will have minimum number of special characters in the password. **Default value is 1.**

## Example

* **No Options passed.**

````javscript
const passwords = require("random-passwords-generator");
password = passwords();
console.log(password);
````

In the above case, no parameter is passed as option. Therefore the default values will be taken - which will have alphabets, both upper and lower case, special characters and will be of length 10 characters.

````javascript
j8GGa3Udr8
````

* **Length parameter passed.**

````javascript
options={
      LENGTH : 25;
      }
password = passwords(options);
console.log(password);
````

The password generated is

````javascript
t4eWL36LxL=h-cnqirU,T841l
````

* **Only Characters(Lower and Upper) Password - Without Numbers and Special Characters**

````javascript
options = {
      LENGTH: 25,
      ALLOW_ALPHABETS_LOWERCASE: true,
      ALLOW_ALPHABETS_UPPERCASE: true,
      ALLOW_NUMBERS: false,
      ALLOW_SPECIAL_CHARACTERS: false,
      EXCEPTIONS: "",
      FIRST_CHARACTER_LOWERCASE: true,
      FIRST_CHARACTER_UPPERCASE: false,
      FIRST_CHARACTER_NUMBER: false,
      FIRST_CHARACTER_SPECIAL_CHARACTER: false,
      MIN_ALPHABETS_LOWERCASE: 1,
      MIN_ALPHABETS_UPPERCASE: 1,
      MIN_NUMBERS: 1,
      MIN_SPECIAL_CHARACTERS: 1,
    };

passwords = password(options);
console.log(passwords);
````

In the above case, the password generated will have alphabets, both lower and uppercase and will not have numbers and special characters.
